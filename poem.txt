The rust programming language
Is strong and true,
With a heart of metal
And a will to renew.

Its strict rules keep us honest,
And its safety net protects,
But it still allows us to be creative,
And build great projects.

Its concurrency is a marvel,
And its performance is top-notch,
It's the language we turn to
When we need something that won't stop.

So here's to rust
A language that we trust,
To help us build the future
And to never, ever rust.
